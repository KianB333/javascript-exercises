GOAL: Create function to return given position in fibonacci sequence.
Context: Fibonacci sequence is sum of previous two numbers, starting with 1 (ex: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).

Function for fibonacci sequence:
- loopCounter starts at 0.
- result starts at 0 (only works because prevResults starts at "1", giving result a starting point to add with).
- prevResult starts at 1. 
- have resultStorage var = result.
- result += prevResult.
- set prevResult to resultStorage.

- return result when loopCounter == sequence position (pos).
