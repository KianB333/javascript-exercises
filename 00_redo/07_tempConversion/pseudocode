Goal: Write two functions to convert temps C to F, or vice versa.
Conditions: Round decimals points to one.
Context: 
    C to F formula: C = (C * [9/5] + 32)
    f to C formula: F = (F - 32) * (5/9)

- Converting back to integer after .toFixed() made non-decimal values
exclude decimal points (i.e., "38.0" to 38).
