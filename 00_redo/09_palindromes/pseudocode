Goal: Check for palindromes
Conditions: Ignore punctuation/whitespaces
Context: Palindromes are words identical to itself if reversed

- Start by removing all punctuation/whitespace/capitalization from string [use .replace() and a RegEx, plus
.toLowerCase()].
- Use a for loop to copy the word letter by letter, starting with string length.
- Compare, return true if they match.
