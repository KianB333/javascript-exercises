- Create new string variable
- Use for loop with length of original as loopCounter
- Use newVar += oldVar.splice(-1, 1) to move last letter one at a time

- Splice is an array method, not a string method.
- loopCounter is 1, keeps going until it hits oldWord.length.
- Use newVar += oldVar.substr(-loopCounter, 1) to copy each letter starting from end of oldWord.
